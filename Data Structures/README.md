# Data Structures

Guuided readings and lecture notes about data structures and algorithms. I have taught these concepts in Java and C++.  
Guided reading includes vocabulary you should know after reading or researching the topic. The questions you should be able to answer after your work on the associated topic. If there is a language specific question or vocab component it will be noted.
